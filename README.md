- 👋 Hi, I am Valeriia!
- 👩‍🎓 I graduated from the HSE Economics program in 2021. I am a student at SPbSU, GSOM faculty in the MiM program.
- 💫 I am passionate about Economics, AI/ML/Data Science, programming, and maths. I prefer to spend my free time learning online courses related to these topics.
- 👩‍💻I have experience working as an SMM manager at a startup called TheSequence(https://thesequence.substack.com/). It's an email newsletter about AI/ML with >120k readers from the main AI Labs and enterprises.
- 🙌I wish to find an internship in Data Analytics/Data Science and have an opportunity to work in an established company. Why? I like it and want to try on this role.
